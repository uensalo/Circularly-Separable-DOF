# Circularly-Separable-DOF
MATLAB implementation of ”Circular Separable Convolution Depth of Field”as discussed in SIGGRAPH 2017.
survey_analysis.pdf discusses the method and the mathematical derivations for the filters.
circular_dof.m, convcomp.m, and convrgb.m contain a toy MATLAB implementation of the method.
